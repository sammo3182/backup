00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,920
Oga, you wrote on your Twitter,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,840
a lengthy thread about what the sanctions

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,790
 can and cannot do to the Russian

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,230
 government. 

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,310
And specifically to put in. 

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,430
And you said that western sanctions

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,750
 will not topple the Russian regime. 

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,610
Why not? 

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,730
In order to understand what the effect

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,810
 of sanctions is on toppling regime? 

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,690
You have to understand how the

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,490
 sanctions impact the ability of the

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,680
 regime or the leader to distribute

14
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,960
 the rents to his or her supporters. 

15
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,020
Now, Russia is not a democracy,

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,540
has not been a democracy since

17
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,540
 I'm gonna say 2003 or so. 

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,810
When we're talking about the supporters of

19
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,170
 the leader, 

20
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,090
the people who supporters critical

21
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,610
 for the leader to stay in power, 

22
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,370
we are talking about the Top el, it es.

23
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,390
So in Russia, these Top el,

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,550
it es can be roughly grouped in 2 groups. 

25
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,210
It's the oligarchs that we hear a lot about. 

26
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,770
Those are the ones whose yards

27
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,640
 are being arrested right now, 

28
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,000
and who's the four foreign

29
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,200
 accounts are being frozen. 

30
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,640
The second group are the strong men. 

31
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,590
So these are the closest

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,380
 friends of president Britain, 

33
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,070
who they usually go back

34
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,150
 to Saint Petersburg times. 

35
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,060
And these are people in government

36
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,900
 positions who have influence on politics. 

37
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,460
The oligarchs not have interest, 

38
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,980
influence on politics. 

39
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,370
So to understand why neither of the 2 groups

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,390
 has any interest to bring down the regime, 

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,710
you have to understand that the

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,670
 oligarchs are affected by the sanctions

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,510
 are probably not supporters of this war. 

44
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,130
The oligars are politically powerless, 

45
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,010
the way putting set up his regimes, 

46
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,860
the ogark essentially got a lot of cash in

47
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,140
 order to completely stay out of politics. 

48
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,200
So the oligarchs, if they speak up,

49
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,590
all we have, 

50
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,990
is to lose what they already have, 

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,270
what they haven't lost

52
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,470
 due to western sanctions. 

53
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,150
But it's the capacitors that they can lose. 

54
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,110
Forgive me for interrupting. 

55
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,350
But I just want to jump in because

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,880
 we've heard so much talk that the

57
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,280
 oligarchs won't like that. 

58
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,960
Their money and their yachts and

59
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,520
 their homes are being taken away

60
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,920
 that their accounts are being frozen. 

61
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,640
And they're going to be the reason why

62
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,160
 puton stops the war against Ukraine. 

63
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,200
What's your take on that analysis? 

64
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,530
I I don't think so. 

65
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,290
I agree. 

66
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,670
Obviously, 

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,570
they're not happy about their

68
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,390
 foreign properties being frozen. 

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,230
They are not happy about losing access to

70
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,430
 their foreign business partners and so on. 

71
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,070
But you have to understand that the

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,470
 majority of the wealth of these

73
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,550
 people is still inside the country. 

74
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,550
And if they speak up against the regime, 

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,550
now they stand to potentially

76
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,630
 lose their position, 

77
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,200
lose their remaining wealth. 

78
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,440
It's still a lot of money, 

79
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,440
even though therefore, 

80
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,640
and assets aren't small. 

81
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,720
So then talk to me about these strong men, 

82
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,560
the secondary group that you're talking

83
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,560
 about are these military and KGB allies of

84
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,060
 prudent that are in strategic positions. 

85
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,540
Now. 

86
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,130
Exactly. 

87
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,210
These are the ST. 

88
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,130
Petersburg group that he brought

89
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,170
 and put into strategic positions. 

90
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,730
These people do have political

91
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,470
 power and do have a lot of

92
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,470
 accents access to the president. 

93
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,960
But the problem with these people is

94
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,360
 that they on the whole are extremely

95
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,800
 ideologically conservative. 

96
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,290
I imagine are happy about the sanctions. 

97
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,870
They would want Russia to

98
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,390
 be isolated from the world. 

99
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,790
They talk about it as fortress Russia. 

100
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,320
They are welcoming anarchy. 

101
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,640
They want Russia to be self sufficient. 

102
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,790
They also are welcoming the hardening of the

103
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,950
 regime that we see in

104
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,910
 response to sanctions. 

105
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,710
They are happy about the regime, 

106
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,430
becoming a full dictatorship, 

107
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,670
extremely repressive. 

108
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,120
That's exactly what they want. 

109
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,480
So they have no reason to topple the regime. 

110
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,940
So it sounds like the two most powerful

111
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,700
 political and economic sets of people. 

112
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,930
In Russia. 

113
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,480
Sanctions are not, 

114
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,680
it's in their interest to keep

115
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,120
 put on in his position. 

116
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,400
Am I understanding that correctly? 

117
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,700
Exactly. 

118
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:54,880
So.
